# K8S in action
  - Install minikube: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
  - Install kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/
  - Kubenetes works with Objects. Objects can be created in 2 ways:
    - Imperatively (bat buoc)
    - Declaratively (khai bao)
  - Pod object:
    - the smallest "unit" k8s interacts with
    - contains and runs 1 or multiple containers
    - Pods contain share resources (e.g. volumes)
    - Has a cluster-internal IP by default; Containers inside a Pod can comminucate via localhost
    - (a Task in AWS ESC is very similar to pod)
    - Pods are designed to be ephemeral (khong ton tai lau): k8s will start/ stop/ replace them as needed
